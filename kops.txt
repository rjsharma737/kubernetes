====Creating a Kubernetes Cluster in AWS using Kops

To deploy a cluster in AWS:

    Create an EC2 Instance Role to be used by the Kops Instance.

    Create and attach IAM role to EC2 Instance. - this instance will be used to manage the cluster externally.

    Use Kops CLI commands to deploy and manage a Kubernetes Cluster

The IAM permissions needed by Kops to function properly are:

    AmazonEC2FullAccess

    AmazonRoute53FullAccess

    AmazonS3FullAccess

    IAMFullAccess

    AmazonVPCFullAccess
	
	
Install Kops on EC2
	
	curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
	chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
    sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops
	
Install kubectl

    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

Create S3 bucket in AWS

S3 bucket is used by kubernetes to persist cluster state, lets create s3 bucket using aws cli Note: Make sure you choose bucket name that is uniqe accross all aws accounts

    aws s3 mb s3://bucketname.in.k8s --region ap-south-1

Create private hosted zone in AWS Route53

    Head over to aws Route53 and create hostedzone
    Choose name for example (javahome.in)
    Choose type as privated hosted zone for VPC
    Select default vpc in the region you are setting up your cluster
    Hit create

Configure environment variables.

Open .bashrc file

	vi ~/.bashrc

Add following content into .bashrc, you can choose any arbitary name for cluster and make sure buck name matches the one you created in previous step.

export KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME=javahome.in
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://bucketname.in.k8s

Then running command to reflect variables added to .bashrc

	source ~/.bashrc

Create ssh key pair

This keypair is used for ssh into kubernetes cluster

    ssh-keygen
	
	
	

Create a Kubernetes cluster definition.

kops create cluster \
--state=${KOPS_STATE_STORE} \
--node-count=2 \
--master-size=t2.micro \
--node-size=t2.micro \
--zones=ap-south-1a,ap-south-1b \
--name=${KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME} \
--dns private \
--master-count 1

Create kubernetes cluster

kops update cluster --yes

Above command may take some time to create the required infrastructure resources on AWS. Execute the validate command to check its status and wait until the cluster becomes ready

    kops validate cluster

For the above above command, you might see validation failed error initially when you create cluster and it is expected behaviour, you have to wait for some more time and check again.


To connect to the master

     ssh admin@api.javahome.in

Destroy the kubernetes cluster

    kops delete cluster  --yes

Update Nodes and Master in the cluster

We can change numner of nodes and number of masters using following commands

   kops edit ig nodes change minSize and maxSize to 0
   kops get ig- to get master node name
   kops edit ig - change min and max size to 0
   kops update cluster --yes
